# AUV_controls_proj
This was my Robot Control team project written in MATLAB. Goal was to simulate trajectory control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

Draft 1 contains the MATLAB files for each phase of the project, 'p1' is the descent of the AUV to a certain depth, 'p2' is the ocean floor search
The '3D' file in Draft 1 combines the results of the 2 parts to create a 3d plot of the simulation
Running the file 'Project_3D' with the other files in the same workspace will run all files

Draft 2 is one file, contains a different descent and search pattern than draft 1, incorporates other team member's ideas
